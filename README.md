# AUV_Assign1and2
### Shivam Singhal Assignment 1 and 2
Check the master branch, and in catkin_ws/src/demo_bot_gazebo, there's a folder by the name of deliverables where, I've added all the relevant deliverables.

Also, in the catkin_ws/src/demo_bot_gazebo/urdf, I've added 
  * bot_1(which is a cylinder) 
  * bot_2(my main bot, I've copied the urdf file from net, and added the camera and laser links, joints and plugins to it)
  * bot_3 and bot_4(which I tried to make on my own, but they could not work properly in gazebo, although they were visualised properly in RViz)
